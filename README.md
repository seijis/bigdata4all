# bigdata4all
This project aims to give access to developers to a Big Data cluster for a low cost, enabling them to execute heavy, distributed computations without having to go through a big company, paying large amounts, and managing the whole installation process. 
The only entry condition is to provide a server that meets the minimum requirements as described in the Requirements pdf file.
The project is experimental and access is only given through invitation for the moment.
